## Story Summary

### Beginning
Freddy the frog adores melodies and dreams of performing in the annual Forest Singing Contest. He practices at the pond, but his croaks are cheerfully off-key. Encouraged by his friends Rosie and Luna, Freddy decides to enter the contest despite nervousness and some teasing from peers.

### Main Conflict
Freddy struggles with self-doubt and outside criticism. Other performers sound smooth and practiced, and Mr. Owl—the contest judge—initially seems to favor polished technique. Freddy tries imitating others but still sounds different. He must decide whether to give up, hide, or perform in his own voice.

### Resolution
Freddy performs at the contest's open-mic and sings with wholehearted enthusiasm rather than technical perfection. His unique croak-song, supported by rhythm from a friend, gradually wins the audience's smiles and applause. Mr. Owl acknowledges Freddy's bravery and invites him to sing again. Freddy gains confidence, pride, and a place in the forest community.

## Main Characters
- Freddy (Main protagonist) — A small, earnest green frog who adores music but is decidedly tone-deaf. Determined, optimistic, and vulnerable; Freddy learns to keep trying and to take pride in his own sound.
- Luna (Mentor / Friend) — A gentle, wise firefly who offers encouragement and practical practice tips. Calm and compassionate, she helps Freddy find confidence and perspective.
- Rosie (Ally / Friend) — A cheerful rabbit who loves to clap and dance to music. Enthusiastic and supportive, she rehearses with Freddy and celebrates his progress.
- Mr. Owl (Judge / Obstacle) — The respected, somewhat stern owl who judges the singing contest. He initially values polished technique but ultimately recognizes courage and heart.

Note: The resolution references a friend who provides rhythm during Freddy's performance (named in the story text). That character is not included in the main character list and can be defined further during development if desired.
